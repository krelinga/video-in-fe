Always run the end-to-end test with `npm run test:e2e` to ensure the latest changes are working correctly.  This will generate several screenshots in the `tests/e2e/screenshots` directory.  These are used as part of the pull request review process.  It is OK for them to change as you make code changes, but if they do change then make sure to commit the new screenshots so that the pull request can be reviewed with the latest changes.  This end-to-end test can take up to 10 minutes to run, so be patient and wait for it to complete.
