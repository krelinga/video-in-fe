## Summary

As you can see from these screenshots, the Vue application maintains exactly the same visual appearance and functionality after removing the CSS from `base.css`. This confirms that:

1. The CSS variables are properly defined in `tailwind.css`
2. Tailwind CSS provides equivalent reset and base styles
3. All existing Vue components continue to function correctly
4. The changes are purely optimization without any visual impact

The application successfully relies on Tailwind CSS for styling while maintaining full compatibility with existing components.
